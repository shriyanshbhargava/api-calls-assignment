# Using Axios to Fetch Users Data from an API

In this approach, the Axios library was employed to retrieve users' data from an external API. The steps taken include:

# Installation:

Axios was added to the project as a dependency using npm or yarn.

## Import Axios:

The Axios library was imported into the JavaScript file that required data retrieval.

## GET Request:

A GET request was made using axios.get() to the API's users endpoint, such as https://api.example.com/users.

## Handling Response:

The retrieved data was processed in the .then() callback function, where you could extract and use the user information.

# Outcome:

Axios made data retrieval from APIs efficient, user-friendly, and robust in JavaScript applications.

# Time-Taken : 90 Minutes
